**RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**

**Filed Science Experiment Lab, Seoul National University** 09/2016 –
02/2023

- Science curriculum (Secondary education): Participated in writing a
  guidebook for high school teachers regarding the 2015 revised
  curriculum.

- Science Instruction: designed blended instruction such as Flipped
  Learning and technology-based instruction incorporating Cooperative
  Learning and Process oriented guided inquiry learning(POGIL) in high
  school science(chemistry) class.

- Cognitive change in science learning: Studied cognitive changes in
  science content understanding according to types of scaffolding.

- Utilization of technology in science education: Developed Application
  of AR-based chemistry education (Chemical bonding App: "Bondbuilder")

- Mentoring and instructor: Mentored 4 high school students for the
  STEAM activity project, and lectured the students who participated in
  this activity.

**Electrochemical Lab, Seoul National University** 03/2014 – 02/2016

- Application of Self-Assembled Monolayer/Multilayer for
  Chemical/Electrochemical Sensing: Synthesized on Nanoparticle with
  Carbon Nanotubes(CNT) or Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes(MWCNT).
  Confirmed of nanocomposites using FT-IR, XRD, TEM, SEM, etc. Modified
  electrochemical Sensor based on gold(Au), Platinum(Pt), Silver(Ag)
  electrodes for Catalyst Development.

- Mentoring: Mentored 4 undergraduate interns in analytical chemistry
  techniques especially electrochemical techniques.
